# Payment History System Updates

## Overview
The payment history page has been enhanced to display both car wash service payments and product sales transactions in a unified view.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Payment History Page (`src/app/(admin)/financial/payments/page.tsx`)
- **Enhanced Interface**: Added support for both `car_wash` and `sales_transaction` types
- **Filter Tabs**: Added filter buttons to view All Transactions, Car Wash Services, or Product Sales separately
- **Unified Data Display**: Shows transactions from both sources in a single table
- **Enhanced Summary Cards**: Added 5 summary cards showing:
  - Total Revenue
  - Completed Transactions
  - Pending Transactions
  - Car Wash Count
  - Product Sales Count

### 2. New API Endpoint (`src/app/api/admin/sales-transactions/route.ts`)
- **Sales Transactions API**: Fetches data from the `sales_transactions` table
- **Filtering Support**: Supports search, status, payment method, and sorting
- **Customer Data**: Includes customer information for each transaction
- **Admin Data**: Includes admin information who processed the sale

### 3. Data Integration
- **Dual Data Sources**: Fetches from both `/api/admin/payments` (car wash) and `/api/admin/sales-transactions` (product sales)
- **Data Transformation**: Converts both data types to a unified `PaymentRecord` format
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where one API might fail
- **Sorting**: Combines and sorts all transactions by date
